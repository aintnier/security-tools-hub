- shadcn/ui: Works with Tailwind v4, requires specific setup process
- Node.js requirement: 20.19+, 22.12+

### Phase 2: Environment Setup ✅
- [x] Create frontend directory structure
- [x] Initialize Vite React project  
- [x] Configure package.json with latest versions

**Setup Results:**
- Vite React+TS project created successfully
- Dependencies installed (React 19.1.1, Vite 7.1.7)
- Development server working on http://localhost:5173

### Phase 3: Tailwind CSS v4 Setup ✅
- [x] Install Tailwind CSS v4
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS v4 (note: v4 has different setup than v3)
- [x] Set up CSS configuration files

**Tailwind v4 Results:**
- Installed `tailwindcss@next @tailwindcss/vite@next`
- Updated `vite.config.ts` with Tailwind plugin
- Configured CSS with `@import "tailwindcss";`
- Note: Vite v7 compatibility issue exists (plugin expects v5-v6)

### Phase 4: shadcn/ui Integration ✅
- [x] Initialize shadcn/ui
- [x] Configure components.json
- [x] Install base shadcn/ui components
- [x] Verify integration works

**shadcn/ui Results:**
- Created `components.json` configuration
- Installed dependencies: `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `class-variance-authority`
- Created Button component manually
- Set up utils.ts and directory structure

### Phase 5: Verification & Testing ⚠️
- [x] Test development server
- [x] Verify Tailwind styles work (in dev mode)
- [x] Test shadcn/ui components
- [x] Create basic example component
- [ ] Production build (has issues due to Vite v7/Tailwind v4 compatibility)

**Final Status: MOSTLY COMPLETE**

## Summary

✅ **Successfully Implemented:**
- React 19.1.1 + Vite 7.1.7 + TypeScript setup
- Tailwind CSS v4 Alpha integration (development mode working)
- shadcn/ui components (Button component working)
- Complete project structure with TypeScript path mapping
- Demo application with technology showcase

⚠️ **Known Issues:**
1. **Build Issues**: Tailwind v4 + Vite v7 compatibility causes production build errors
2. **Alpha Software**: Tailwind v4 is alpha, may have stability issues
3. **Peer Dependencies**: Required `--legacy-peer-deps` for installations

## Next Steps for Production Ready:
1. Consider downgrading to Vite v6 for better Tailwind v4 compatibility
2. Wait for Tailwind v4 stable release
3. Or use Tailwind v3 for production stability

**Development server works perfectly at http://localhost:5173**
