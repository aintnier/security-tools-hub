# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

- Build a frontend prototype for a security/IT automation dashboard featuring:
  - Password generator with strength evaluation.
  - AI image create and describe tools.
  - URL shortener with minimal analytics.
- Stack decisions: React + Vite (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand. Security by design via OWASP XSS and CSP guidance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, React 18, Node 20.19+ (or 22.12+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite, Tailwind CSS v4 (+ @tailwindcss/vite), shadcn/ui, React Router, @tanstack/react-query, zustand, dompurify  
**Storage**: N/A (frontend only; server state via HTTP)  
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (to be added in Phase 2 tasks)  
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (ESM), dev in WSL on Windows  
**Project Type**: web (frontend), anticipating backend integration via contracts  
**Performance Goals**: Fast initial load (<150KB JS after gzip for prototype), responsive interactions <100ms  
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.2 AA a11y, no inline scripts/styles to enable strict CSP later, avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`  
**Scale/Scope**: Prototype with 3 feature views, shared layout, basic settings

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

Given the placeholder constitution, adopt pragmatic gates:

- Test-First intent: Define contracts and plan tests before implementation (Phase 1/2). OK.
- Simplicity: Single frontend app; no premature micro-frontends. OK.
- Observability/Docs: Plan and research artifacts added under `specs/...`. OK.
- Security: Follow OWASP XSS/CSP; avoid unsafe sinks; plan CSP rollout. OK.

Initial Constitution Check: PASS

# Option 1: Single project (DEFAULT)
src/
├── models/
├── services/
├── cli/
└── lib/

├── contract/
├── integration/
└── unit/

# Option 2: Web application (when "frontend" + "backend" detected)

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)
api/
└── [same as backend above]

ios/ or android/
└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application). Keep `frontend/` for app; contracts/docs remain under `specs/001-un-applicazione-web/`. Backend TBD.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
